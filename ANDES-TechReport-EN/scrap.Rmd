<!-- Québec situation -->
The Québec Region follows a similar timeline. Many survey teams use a deprecated Visual Basic Application that connects to a mission-specific Microsoft Access database.
Their technicians often have to resort to pen and paper to perform activities unsupported by the application.
In some cases, all data entry activities completed during surveys are performed in this manner.
The use of various entry methods such as Microsoft Excel, paper, and a legacy application have been reported by these teams.
These data later have to be manually consolidated which is time consuming and error prone.
Interest in modernizing the tooling and workflow has been expressed.
This imminent need, together with the successful proof-of-concept demonstration of Andes in the Gulf region, presents an opportunity for inter-regional collaboration.
