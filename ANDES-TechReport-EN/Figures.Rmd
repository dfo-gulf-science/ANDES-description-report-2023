(ref:screenshot-fishing-console-caption) A screenshot of Andes Fishing Console withing the Bridge App. This screenshot shows some quality control validation features including: the fishing timer, the distance display and an alarm message for when the vessel is travelling outside the target stratum. On the bottom left of the screenshot, output from the net monitoring system is displayed. The large buttons in the center of the display are used to trigger fishing events.

\clearpage

(ref:bridge-caption) A screenshot of the Andes Bridge console. This app is used by bridge personnel across multiple user scenarios. This dashboard is a critical link in the communication between the scientist and crew personnel. An example of this is the station list; as a chief scientist plans out his or her route, queue stations and the associated activities will appear in the Bridge console. The Bridge console is also used by bridge officers to trigger the start and ends of operations and to input set metadata.

knitr::include_graphics("./figures/screenshot_bridge_console.png")
```
\clearpage

(ref:dashboard-caption) A screenshot of the Andes Cruise Dashboard. This dashboard helps to communicate queued stations, fishing activities underway and estimated times of arrival to science staff and crew personnel. The dashboard also displays high level summaries of Science activities that were conducted.
