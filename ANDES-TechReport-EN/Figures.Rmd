(ref:bridge-caption) A screenshot of the Andes Bridge console. This app is used by bridge personnel across multiple user scenarios. This dashboard is a critical link in the communication between the scientist and crew personnel. An example of this is the station list; as a chief scientist plans out his or her route, queue stations and the associated activities will appear in the Bridge console. The Bridge console is also used by bridge officers to trigger the start and ends of operations and to input set metadata.
