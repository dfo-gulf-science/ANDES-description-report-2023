# Methods
The \gls{ese} was the starting point in the development of \gls{andes}.
The replacement data entry software had to first replicate the proven functional capabilities of \gls{ese}.
Early version of \gls{andes} achieved those goals and the system was further developed over its usage by scientists in the Gulf Region. Additionally, the \gls{mrr}
Other opportunistic design goals also existed, including the use of a contemporary software development environment, the ability to support multiple languages, flexibility in deployment and using a shared code development environment.

## Technical implementation of design goals

The following section outlines the design principles that played a role in decision-making during the development of Andes and provide a description of how they were implemented.

### Flexibility, scalability and reliability

Within the context of DFO Science, there is a high number of use-cases under which this application can be deployed. For example, the number of users might range from a single user with a tablet, to several dozen scientists participating in a research cruise. Similarly, the application might sometimes be used in a networked setting while other times used in the field on a stand-alone tablet. Accordingly, the application has to accommodate a wide range of practical scenarios.

The development environment used for the application must be a contemporary programming language with a proven track record for performance, usability and adaptability.  

### Version Control / Source Control

The utilization of a \gls{vcs} is an indispensable component of a sustainable development workflow. Version management is especially important in the context of having concurrent instances of the application in production at any given time. Knowing the version of a production instance is necessary to resolve any issues that might arise. Similarly, databases and backup files are intimately linked to an application's version number. In order to successfully re-instantiate a backup file, the precise version under which it was produced must be known. The VCS will also provide an indispensable framework for the coordination, examination and integration of contributions from collaborators.

### Unit testing

The application also needs to be reliable especially considering its use in a field setting. The implementation of unit tests is a practical way to ensure the maintenance of functionality over time. At one extreme, the addition of any code can be preceded by the creation of unit tests (i.e., test-driven development). This approach will maximize the stability of an application, but can hinder the momentum of a project, especially in its early stages. At the other extreme, application development in the complete absence of unit testing occurs at a relatively fast pace but will result in a project that is vulnerable to breaking in unexpected ways and one that is difficult to maintain and pass on to other developers. 

### User-defined protocols

The flexibility of project leads to design, modify and report on their sampling protocol without depending on developers is very important. The application should allow users to provide a variety of detailed information based on their particular sampling protocols, without the need to change the application source code.

### User Interface

By ensuring the application has a modern and intuitive interface, the barriers related to onboarding new users are significantly reduced. Furthermore, an intuitive interface will reduce the need for extensive help documentation. Wherever extra annotation is required, documentation should be inserted directly in the application in the form of tool tips and help bubbles. By appealing to the end users' intuitions and by providing in-situ help documentation, we reduce the likelihood fields and features being used incorrectly. 

### Reactivity

In the context of being on a research vessel survey, data entry happens at a very fast rate and on numerous devices; often with multiple transactions per second. Accordingly, it is imperative that the application does not create a bottleneck for data entry and is able to keep pace with experienced technicians. The usage of a reactive javascript library in conjunction with an \gls{api} would allow data entry to occur without webpages having to constantly refresh.

### Multilingualism

The ability for users to choose the language of their choice in the application is of considerable importance to this project. Previous tools that have been used were unilingual, and this by itself would have limited the scope of their use in a national context. 

### Backup Regime and infrastructure


## Usage cases

### Ecosystem survey data entry

The  system is designed to be deployed as the main data entry platform for ecosystem survey operations. It should allow the capture of all the information required by the sampling protocols of the survey (e.g. @hurlbut-clay-1990). This entails the capture of all information related to fishing activities, including ancillary variables such as weather, sea state, water temperature. Catch contents are sorted and identified during scientific surveys, so the data capture application needs to support users in obtaining catch weights and abundance by taxon, individual observation of a specimen's length, weight, maturity status, etc. The application should also flag to the users when specimens are to be collected, or when additional sampling requirements are present (e.g. collecting fish otoliths).

### Oceanographic metadata collection

Biological surveys often collect complementary oceanographic data. Coordinating these data with the associated biological data is often a burdensome logistical challenge. Historically, the different types of data were captured and recorded using separate systems that operated in complete isolation from one another. Ideally, a data entry tool could streamline the capture of oceanographic data and simplify its association with the corresponding biological data. 


### Commercial port sampling

Another use of the software is to support data collection during sampling of commercial port sampling activities [@Benoit-Daigle-2007]. This module is meant to be deployed on field tablets for scientific staff that collect data related to commercial fishing activities. A typical usage case is to obtain length frequency samples from commercial landings, and to also obtain length-stratified hard parts used for age estimation, and also the collection of whole individuals for later processing in the laboratory.
