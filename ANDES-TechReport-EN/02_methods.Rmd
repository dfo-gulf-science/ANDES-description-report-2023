# Methods
The ESE was the starting point in the development of ANDES. The data entry software had to first replicate the capabilities of the ESE.

## Intended use of the software
The ANDES system is designed to be deployed as the main data entry platform during ecosystem surveys. 

Another use of the software is to support data collection during sampling of commerical port sampling activities. [@Benoit-Daigle-2007]

## Design principles
The interface is user-friendly and is multilingual. 

## Technical implementation
The software is written in the Python programming language using the Django development environment.

### Data model
