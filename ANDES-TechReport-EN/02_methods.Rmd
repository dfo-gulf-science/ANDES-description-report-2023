# Methods
The ESE was the starting point in the development of ANDES. The data entry software had to first replicate the capabilities of the ESE.

## Intended use of the software
The ANDES system is designed to be deployed as the main data entry platform during ecosystem surveys. 

Another use of the software is to support data collection during sampling of commercial port sampling activities. [@Benoit-Daigle-2004]

## Design principles



The interface is user-friendly and is multilingual.

## Technical implementation
The software is written in the Python programming language using the Django development environment.

### Data model

Full ERD on Figure \@ref(fig:ERD)

### Version control software
All source code is under version control software.

### Backup Regime and infrastructure
- Backup are automatically created when sets are closed
- All backup files reference the version of the application which produced them. Even old backups can be loaded by locally re-instantiating the version of the application under which it was produced

## Integration of ANDES with existing data repositories
