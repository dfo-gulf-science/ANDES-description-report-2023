# Discussion

The current capabilities of \gls{andes} have evolved over the last three years where the system has been used to support field activities in the Gulf Region. The software has also been used by the Maritimes and Quebec regions of DFO. 

Since its initial deployment during the 2020 September survey in the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence, the capabilities and performance of \gls{andes} have improved. The forecasting tool and progress map presented in this report were not in the original deployment of the application and were added during the cruise based on the needs of scientific and \gls{CCG} personnel.

The reporting facilities provided by \gls{andes} were developed to support the many users of the data collected during scientific activities. Two types of reports are available for \gls{andes}: 1) reports meant to be used during field activities and 2) reports meant to be used after field activities are completed. 

If a vessel is located within range of cellular phone signals, it is possible to make \gls{andes} accessible via the internet. 

Versioning details and why the backup process is so awesome.

When present, the client-server separation lends itself nicely to be adaptable to new requirements. One can potentially expand upon the *system* with minimal changes to \gls{andes} by interacting directly with its exposed \gls{REST-API}. For example, an imaging system can be aware of current GPS coordinates or current \gls{Set} / \gls{Station}. Photos or videos acquired by such an imaging system could automatically append these as metadata, or even add media identifiers directly to the database as they are captured.


Most modern vessels will already provide the minimum necessary networking infrastructure necessary for system deployment where connectivity between a dry laboratory, a wet laboratory and the ship's wheelhouse are necessary. In the case where it doesn't, this requirement can be met relatively easily using inexpensive consumer-grade networking equipment (wireless router, switch, etc.). However, installing as ad-hoc network for scientific needs in a vessel may lead to code violations there we urge \gls{andes} users to collaborate with vessel management body like the \gls{CCG} or chartering authority.



Sampling programs should explicitly discuss the use of allow-lists and restrict-lists.

## Integration of Andes with existing data repositories

\gls{andes} is a standalone application with an underlying relational database management system, and the data collected during research activities must be extracted from the application and integrated into existing databases. 

## Future Directions

Onboarding efforts for coastal surveys (scallop, sea-cucumber, whelk) is underway. 
The development of \gls{andes} has led to close inter-regional collaboration and presented a number of challenges.

- \gls{azmp} / oceanographic surveys
- use for ecosystem surveys by multiple DFO regions
- use of barcodes and/or QR codes for identifying and tracking down samples (e.g. otoliths, tissue samples, ...)

## Governance

\gls{andes} does not currently have a well-defined governing body. This makes it, as well as any project without governance, vulnerable. To alleviate this situation, we ask that this technical document as well as the developer's guide be considered when outsourcing development efforts towards \gls{andes}. This will ensure that the core vision is maintained and that software sustainability principles are upheld.

<!-- it has boundaries -->
\gls{andes} reached a critical point in its lifecycle. It has been used as the main data entry strategy in numerous missions over the span of a few years. Although new features can always be added, its core functional requirements can now be locked-in.
The boundaries are now well-defined and described in this report.

We thank all DFO personnel who were involved in the early testing and deployment of \gls{andes} prior to and during the 2020 southern Gulf of St. Lawrence ecosystem survey. We thank the Gulf Region publications coordinator, Dr. Jeffery Clements, for his assistance with getting this document published.
