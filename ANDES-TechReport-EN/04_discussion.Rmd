# Discussion

The current capabilities of Andes have evolved over the last three years where the system has been used to support field activities in the Gulf Region. The software has also been used by the Maritimes and Quebec regions of DFO. 

Versioning details and why the backup process is so awesome.

Things will change.


## Creation and maintenance of unit tests



## Integration of Andes with existing data repositories

Discuss the steps required to go from data collected in Andes to transferring them to existing databases. 


## Future Directions

- \gls{azmp} / oceanographic surveys
- use for ecosystem surveys by multiple DFO regions
- use of barcodes and/or QR codes for identifying and tracking down samples (e.g. otoliths, tissue samples, ...)


<!-- governance -->
Andes does not currently have a well-defined governing body.
This makes it, as well as any project without governance, vulnerable. 
To alleviate this situation, we ask that this technical document as well as the developer's guide be considered when outsourcing development efforts towards Andes.
This will ensure that the core vision is maintained and that software sustainability principles are upheld.

<!-- it has boundaries -->
Andes reached a critical point in its lifecycle.
It has been used as the main data entry strategy in numerous missions over the span of a few years.
Although new features can always be added, its core functional requirements can now be locked-in.
The boundaries are now well-defined and described in this report.
