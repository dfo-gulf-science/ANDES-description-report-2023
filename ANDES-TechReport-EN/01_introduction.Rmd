# Introduction {#sec:introduction}
Scientific activities conducted by Fisheries and Oceans Gulf Region include ecosystem surveys and port sampling activities. These monitoring programs require the collection of a variety of information about marine ecosystems and about commercial fishery activities. 

To support the data collection during ecosystem surveys, a paper-based system was initially used on board research vessels. With the advent of computing capabilities, the paper data sheets were digitized and the information was stored for subsequent analyses. In the 1980s, a data entry system was created by DFO to allow for the direct entry of data in digital format. The Groundfish Survey Entry (GSE) system was used during research cruises from the mid 1980s until the deployment of its successor system, the Ecosystem Entry System (ESE) in the early 2000s. 

The ESE is a data entry system built using Microsoft Access and relies on forms to capture data entry. The development of the ESE was done by one scientist in the Maritimes Region and required the packaging of the system prior to conducting the survey and had limited room for customization once deployed on the vessel. This led to the development of a bespoke flexible and bilingual data entry system by the Gulf Region starting in 2019. The ESE was the main data entry system used by the Gulf Region until 2020 when ANother Data Entry System (ANDES) was first used during the annual September survey.

This report documents the design principles that guided the development of ANDES, provides technical details about its implementation and details the usage cases where the software has been used so far. We also provide a roadmap to facilitate the deployment of ANDES to support other field activities and discuss the ways in which the system could gain further adoption within DFO.
