# Introduction {#sec:introduction}

The scientific activities conducted by the Atlantic regions of the \gls{dfo} include ecosystem surveys, sentinel fisheries programs, coastal surveys, port sampling activities and many others. 
These monitoring programs require the collection of a wide variety of information about marine ecosystems and commercial fishery activities.
To support the data collection those surveys, paper-based systems were initially used during field work on research vessels, fishing vessels or at commercial ports. 
With the advent of computing capabilities, paper data sheets were digitized and the resulting data was stored for subsequent analyses. In the 1980s and early 2000s, a number of computer-based data entry systems were developed, in particular to support the activities of scientific ecosystem cruises where a variety of instruments are used to collect data. For trawl surveys, this meant a tool that could support the activities associated with processing the catches from the net, and that could also be used to manage survey activities while at sea. In the Maritimes and Gulf regions, the \gls{gse} and later the \gls{ese} were deployed on workstations in the wet laboratory of research ships. These applications supported the capture of data about individual specimens, including the collection of length frequencies and more detailed sampling based on the survey goals. In the Quebec Region, a similar tool called the Module des Relev√©s de Recherche (MRR) was allowed for the direct entry of data in digital format on the research vessel.

The later versions of those data entry systems were built with Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) and relied on Microsoft Access databases. While highly functional,
the ESE and the MRR have important limitations:

- Despite being used over a \gls{lan}, these tools are not designed to work in a networked configuration.
- These tools are unilingual (French or English depending on the region) and their infrastructure does not readily support multiple languages in their user interface.
- \gls{vb}, the main development frameworks used to build the applications, are legacy programming language. To adapt the software using modern libraries and \gls{api} in \gls{vb} will become increasingly difficult over time.
- The use of a \gls{vcs} is incompatible with the Microsoft Access database that \gls{vb} applications rely on. The absence of a \gls{vcs} presents serious challenges for managing, disseminating and troubleshooting versions of an application across multiple platforms and is a major impediment for a collaborative approach to development.
- While these applications were built by DFO, multiple attempts to obtain support for these tools from \gls{imts} were unsuccessful.
- This lack of support means that technicians often resort to either Excel or pen and paper to perform activities unsupported by the applications.
  Using multiple entry methods means that the data has to be manually consolidated at a later date which is time consuming and error prone.
- The lack of a true server-side application (e.g. web application) meant that agile development was effectively impossible; especially in the context of a mission that was underway.

While the status quo was meeting the immediate data capture needs of scientists, a proactive stance towards addressing the above spurred the development of **An**other **d**ata **e**ntry **s**ystem (Andes).
This project began during the summer of 2018, the first field deployment on Andes took place in the fall of 2019 during the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence September survey, where it was piloted in parallel to the \gls{ese} on board the *CCGS Teleost*.


<!-- Andes suffers from this -->
A growing user-base that wish to add functional requirements can lead to a bad system design.
This is especially true when affecting software components having different maturity levels.
Development patterns such as contractual work specifically focused on adding a niche feature can easily lead to the accumulation of technical dept.

This report documents the design principles that guided the development of Andes, provides technical details about its implementation and details the usage cases encountered thus far.
It provide guidelines for assessing the suitability of Andes for novel applications (e.g., other field activities and sampling programs) and discuss the ways in which the application could gain further adoption in supporting data collections activities within DFO.
