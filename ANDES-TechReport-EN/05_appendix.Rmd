<!-- The following code should appear at the beginning of the first appendix.
(if you have one)
After that, all subsequent sections will be turned into appendices. -->

`r if(knitr:::is_latex_output()) '% begin csasdown appendix'`
`r if(!knitr:::is_latex_output()) '# (APPENDIX) Appendix {-}'`

# Tasks for administrative user
Prior to a survey, a number of configurations must be done for \gls{andes} to function as intended. At a minimum, the following information must be provided and ingested by Andes in order for a mission to take place:

\begin{description}
\item[Strata polygons]{}
\item[List of stations]{}
\item[Species list]{}
\item[Sampling requirements]{}
\end{description}


# Further resources about Andes

The main git repository supporting the development of the application is hosted by \gls{imts}. The following resources can be found there:

- deployment checklist
- species lists for Gulf, Maritimes and Quebec
- strata polygons 
- sampling requirements from previous surveys

<!-- At the end of your appendices add: -->
`r if(knitr:::is_latex_output()) '% end csasdown appendix'`
