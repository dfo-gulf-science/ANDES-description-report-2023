<!-- The following code should appear at the beginning of the first appendix.
(if you have one)

# Tasks for administrative user
Prior to a survey, a number of configurations must be done for Andes to function as intended. At a minimum, the following information must be ingested by Andes in order for a mission to take place:

\begin{enumerate}
\item{Strata polygons}
\item{List of stations}
\item{Species list}
\item{Sampling requirements}
\end{enumerate}


# Further resources about Andes

The main git repository supporting the development of the application is hosted by \gls{imts}. The following resources can be found there:

- deployment checklist
- species lists for Gulf, Maritimes and Quebec
- strata polygons 
- sampling requirements from previous surveys



<!-- At the end of your appendices add: -->
`r if(knitr:::is_latex_output()) '% end csasdown appendix'`
