## User definitions and permissions
Andes provides access to its different components differently based on the credentials of users. While the chief scientist can change sampling requirements for the mission, other users won't.

## Ecosystem survey app
This component of Andes replicates the capabilities of the ESE for capturing detailed information on length, weight, ageing material, maturity, etc. about fish and invertebrate specimens. 

### App used in the laboratory
The app running on computers in the wet laboratory of the vessel is used for all entry of data related to measurements and observations of marine organisms.

### App used in the bridge
The console to be used by navigation officers is meant to run on a tablet in the bridge of the vessel conducting the survey.

This console contains two separate sections: 1) the Set Card section and 2) the Fishing section.

Additionally, a number of events that take place during fishing can be captured in the console.

Information coming from Scanmar sensors are captured and stored by ANDES.

### Forecasting tool
Part of the task-specific suite of utilities is a forecasting tool that provides real-time prognostics of survey completion targets based on assumed transit speeds and time spent fishing and processing the trawl catches. 

### Progress map
Another task-specific utility is the completion map which shows what strata have been completed based on target and minimum number of sets per stratum.

### Reporting capabilities
Two types of reports are available for Andes: 1) reports meant to be used during field activities and 2) reports meant to be used after field activites are completed.

## Shrimp ecosystem survey app
Quebec: Denis and Brian could contribute here?

## Oceanography app
The oceanography data collection is handled by a separate app that is used in the deployment of the rosette and the processing of water samples obtained at different depths.

## Cruise dashboard
This utility is meant to obtain a summary of the cruise, it includes the current position and speed of the vessel, the list of the most recent catches in the wet laboratory, as well as running totals of specimens captured.


## Port sampling app
Andes was adapted to support port sampling activities where technicians obtain length frequency samples from commercial fishing activities. To facilitate deployment, the port sampling app of Andes is deployed on field tablets with a custom interface that is suitable for use on boats, outdoor and in inclement weather conditions (Figure \@ref(fig:portsampling1)).


## Tasks for administrative user
Prior to a survey, a number of configurations must be done for Andes to function as intended. At a minimum, the following information must be ingested by Andes in order for a mission to take place:

\begin{enumerate}
\item{Strata polygons}
\item{List of stations}
\item{Species list}
\item{Sampling requirements}
\end{enumerate}


## Backup regime and infrastructure


### Unit Tests

A number of unit tests have been created for the application.

## Data models

Simplified Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD) of the following components:

### Sampling Protocols
### Ecosystem Survey
### Port Sampling
### Oceanography


### Integration with navigation system and trawl sensors

Full ERD on Figure \@ref(fig:ERD)

### Collaborative development 

- translations were done in house
- they must be up-kept along with development

- at the time of writing this document, the project has a total of 6 contributor to the code.

## Deployment Checklist

Here is a deployment checklist for deploying an instance of the Andes application in a production environment:

[//]: # (This list is taken straigh out of the code repo. It will have to be beefed up with more explanations and context)

- [ ] It is always a good practice to set the `DEBUG` setting to `False`.
   Using DEBUG in production can result in memory leakage.
   The debug setting is set via the project's .env file, located in the andes root directory (e.g. `/opt/andes_root/andes/.env`)
- [ ] Set Andes Leads and Chief Scientists to Admin users.
- [ ] Make sure GPS is working on site
- [ ] Make sure printer is working on site
- [ ] Make sure the backup works
- [ ] Make sure custom maps are working (if applicable)
- [ ] Check everything again after a reboot of the server
- [ ] Make sure you can run shell scripts from the front end (optional)
- [ ] Alderbarren setup
- [ ] Reset the Specimen table autoincrement (see [basic_setup](/setup_basic.md))
- [ ] If using cradlepoint, has web filtering been turned on?
- [ ] Check to make sure that the time/date on any clients (especially Bridge clients) are in sync with server time
