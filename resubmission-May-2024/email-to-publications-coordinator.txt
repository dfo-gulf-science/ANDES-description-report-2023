Dear Gulf Region publications coordinator,
Thank you for the positive feedback about our technical report titled "Design goals, technical implementation and practical use of Another data entry system (Andes)". We believe that the report is now ready for publication as a Canadian Technical Report of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences. 

We have addressed all the reviewers comments, which are attached to this message as a separate document with our detailed reponses to the reviewers. The current version of the document is also attached to this message.

We look forward to hearing from you about the publication of our report.

All the best.
